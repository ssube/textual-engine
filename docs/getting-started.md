## Engine Concepts

### Commands

Each step, each actor looks at the last command that was parsed by its input service. For players, that is
the command you entered on the CLI. For NPCs, that is a command generated by their behavior.

The actor's step script runs the command, moving entities and printing output.

### Entities

The game world is made of entities, such as actors, items, and rooms.

### Scripts

When events are fired in the game world, the script service looks for matching entities and invokes the named script
for each entity, with that entity as the target.
